# SnakeAI-DeepLearning

## Overview

SnakeAI-DeepLearning is a project that utilizes Deep Learning techniques to train an AI agent to play the classic Snake game autonomously. The AI agent is trained using reinforcement learning, where it learns to maximize its score by playing multiple rounds of Snake, gradually improving its strategy and performance.

## Features

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Implements reinforcement learning algorithms to train the AI, such as Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
- **Customizable Training Environment**: Allows adjustments to the game environment and training parameters to fine-tune the AI's performance.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Visualizes the AI's learning process and gameplay in real-time, showing how the AI adapts and improves over time.
- **Performance Tracking**: Logs performance metrics like score and learning rate during training for analysis and optimization.

## How It Works

The AI agent is trained using a Deep Q-Network (DQN), which is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm. The agent interacts with the Snake game environment by taking actions (moving the snake) and receiving rewards based on its performance (e.g., eating food, avoiding collisions). Over time, the agent learns to optimize its actions to maximize the cumulative reward, resulting in a higher score.
